In order for anyone to run the .exe 
they will need a folder that contains
all of the assets the game requires to run.

That means this folder needs to be in that folder,
in the exact state that it is in.

take the Assets folder and place it in the 
Release folder, that folder can run this game if 
the person has visual c++ runtimes
installed on their computer.

we would need an installer package to 
be sure that this program can run on 
anyones computer
